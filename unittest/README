This unittest framework is borrowed from OCE (see
https://github.com/tpaviot/oce).

To run these tests, first compile GoogleTest from the source code available in
the folder "heekscad/unittest/gtest-1.6.0" like so:

$ cd unittest/gtest-1.6.0/lib
$ cmake ..
$ make

Afterward, the CMake builder should find the proper library and headers
locations.
